# **ML With Excel**

## **Overview**  
This project explores the implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the type of contact lenses (none, soft, or hard) for individuals based on their attributes. Leveraging a small dataset of 24 records, the project demonstrates the fundamental principles of machine learning, focusing on **manual calculations and data analysis using Excel**. The emphasis is on understanding probability theory, applying Laplace smoothing to handle zero-frequency issues, and showcasing Excel as a key analytical tool.

## **Key Features**

### **Dataset**:
- A structured dataset with 24 records and the following attributes:
  - **Age** (Young, Pre-presbyopic, Presbyopic)
  - **Prescription Type** (Myope, Hypermetrope)
  - **Astigmatism** (Yes/No)
  - **Tear Production Rate** (Reduced/Normal)
  - **Contact Lens Type** (None, Soft, Hard)

### **Naive Bayes Classifier**:
- Developed manually by calculating probabilities for each attribute combination.
- Incorporated **Laplace smoothing** to handle zero-frequency issues, ensuring robust predictions even for unseen attribute combinations.

### **Prediction Task**:
- Predicted the type of contact lenses for a new individual with the following attributes:
  - **Age**: Young  
  - **Prescription**: Myope  
  - **Astigmatism**: Yes  
  - **Tear Production Rate**: Normal  
- Classified the individual into one of three categories: none, soft, or hard.

## **Tools Used**

### **Excel as the Core Analysis Tool**:
- **Data Organization**:  
  - Structured the dataset into well-defined tables for clarity and efficiency.  
- **Probabilistic Calculations**:  
  - Used Excel formulas to compute conditional probabilities and posterior probabilities manually.  
  - Applied smoothing techniques directly within Excel to adjust for zero-frequency issues.  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Created clear tables and charts to represent probability distributions and classification results.  
- **Error-Free Manual Implementation**:  
  - Excel's structured approach ensured accurate calculations and reproducibility.

## **Project Highlights**

- **Manual Implementation**:  
  - Built the Naive Bayes classifier without using programming languages, demonstrating an in-depth understanding of its mechanics and theory.  
- **Excel Mastery**:  
  - Showcased the versatility of Excel as a data analysis and computation tool for machine learning tasks.  
- **Zero-Frequency Smoothing**:  
  - Applied smoothing techniques to address gaps in the dataset, ensuring robust predictions.  
- **Comprehensive Workflow**:  
  - The end-to-end process, from data preparation to predictions, was completed entirely in Excel.

## **Key Takeaways**  
This project highlights the power of Excel for performing complex data analysis and machine learning tasks in a manual yet structured manner. By focusing on the theoretical underpinnings of the Naive Bayes algorithm, I gained a deeper understanding of probabilistic models and the importance of data preparation. This experience not only strengthened my skills in Excel but also enhanced my ability to apply machine learning concepts without relying on automated tools or programming languages.
